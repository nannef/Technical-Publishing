      <abstract>
Impact Exchanges require distinct measurement frameworks across asset
classes (corporate securities, impact investments, commodities) due to
fundamental differences in how environmental and social outcomes are
quantified, verified, and reported within each market segment. We
propose use of a “meta-standards” approach for incorporating measurement
of environmental and social outcomes—establishing overarching principles
for outcome measurement while allowing methodological flexibility -
supported by a technical committee to ensure market integrity and
framework interoperability. Short-term market demands for simple metrics
must be balanced against systemic risks, as evidenced by carbon markets
where inadequate standardization and verification led to market
fragmentation and credibility issues.

          <p>Measurement and verification of environmental and social
      outcomes to inform financial investment is a rapidly evolving
      field. A wide variety of measurement and verification methods are
      currently used to assess the environmental and social performance
      of diverse financial instruments for diverse asset classes. These
      methods are commonly applied as a subset of overarching frameworks
      and standards implementation—for positive and negative
      environmental, social and governance (ESG) screening, impact
      investment, corporate disclosure of impacts and dependencies,
      sustainability certification or benchmarking, and other topic
      areas. These frameworks and standards are characterised by highly
      varied degrees of: formal standardisation, public or private
      sector involvement, intellectual property licensing models, and
      transparency.</p>

          <p>Establishing public exchanges based on verified environmental
      and social outcomes (“Impact Exchanges”) involves careful design
      choices—about the specific measurement and verification methods,
      frameworks and standards that determine market disclosures. These
      design choices depend fundamentally on the scope of assets or
      instruments that can be traded—for example Impact Exchanges
      focused on:</p>
          <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p>corporate securities might be best underpinned by holistic
          disclosure frameworks such as those maintained by the Capitals
          Coalition (e.g. the Natural Capital Protocol), or Taskforces
          for Nature-Related, and Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
          (TNFD and TCFD respectively).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>enabling impact investment might be best underpinned by the
          existing dedicated frameworks such as Global Impact Investing
          Network’s (GIIN) IRIS+, the Social Return on Investment
          (SROI), the Social Performance Task Force (SPTF), B Impact
          Assessment (BIA) by B Lab, and the Impact Management Project
          (IMP).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>commodities or real property may be well matched with
          primary low-level measurement frameworks such as those
          developed for specific sectoral raw material supply chains
          (e.g. apparel, minerals and metals, etc), or environmental
          characteristics (e.g. pollution levels, in-situ
          biodiversity).</p>

          <p>Predicating an Impact Exchange on specific primary outcome
      methods is fraught with risk—the Australian and global political
      economy for environmental and social measurement, verification,
      and reporting in characterised by rapid innovation and is far from
      a state of maturity. Different frameworks and standards have
      highly heterogenous subject matter scopes, methodological design
      and underlying commercial or values-based imperatives. This
      complicates any assessment of trade-offs between different
      exchange design choices, and creates risks of adverse consequences
      and path dependencies if premature choices are made to adopt
      certain methods, frameworks or standards.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>In the near term, we recommend a “meta-standards” approach to
      the design of the proposed Australian Impact Exchange (AIX) that
      focuses on preserving market integrity through transparent,
      principles-based and market-driven evolution of methods for
      measurement and verification of environmental and social outcomes.
      Some candidate principles, which would benefit from further
      consultation and research, are summarised below:</p>
          <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p>Principle 1: Traded assets should disclose both their
          primary environmental and social outcomes (quantified or
          qualified as appropriate) and the methodological basis for
          assessing those outcomes.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Principle 2: The disclosed methodological basis for
          disclosure should be compatible with certain quality standards
          intended to support alignment with general fiduciary
          principles and Australian consumer regulation. They
          should:</p>
              <list list-type="bullet">
                <list-item>
                  <p>Transparently document their definitional foundations,
              input data and assessment methods. Low-level definitions
              should be aligned with the System of
              Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) as appropriate,
              in particular to avoid confusion between measurement of
              environmental stocks (e.g. the extent and/or condition of
              specific ecosystem types aligned to the IUCN Global
              Ecosystem Typology) and flows of goods and services from
              the environment to the economy (e.g. carbon sequestration,
              regulation of waste, flows of raw materials)–see Figure 1
              below.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>Clearly document their functional, geographical and
              value chain scope coverage (e.g. 1+2 vs 3) and use
              pre-defined categories aligned to the SEEA and other
              relevant global statistical standards.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
            </list-item>
          </list>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>We also suggest that a standing technical committee should be
      incorporated into the governance planning for the AIX with a clear
      remit to iteratively refine and develop meta-standards concerning
      social and environmental outcome disclosure, and facilitate
      pre-competitive dialogue between different frameworks, standards
      and approaches.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>A pragmatic alternative to the “meta-standards” approach
      suggested above would be to establish an Impact Exchange based on
      clear social and environmental outcome metrics for which there is
      short-term market demand. One advantage of this approach is the
      ability to generate liquidity and positive margins that could be
      reinvested into improving and scaling the Impact Exchange. A key
      risk is that metrics may evolve in response to ad hoc demand
      drivers without sufficient attention to generating the coherence,
      robustness and transparency needed to bring investment in
      environmental and social outcomes to scale. The fundamental
      structural deficiencies of both voluntary and statutory carbon
      markets identified in recent years offers a pertinent cautionary
      tale.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref></p>

          <p>The Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) is
      exploring research and commercialisation opportunities in
      sustainable finance, with a specific focus on how can digital
      finance toolkits be used to unlock the resources needed to
      transition Australia towards a more resilient, decarbonised,
      regenerative and just economy. As part of this agenda, the DFCRC
      is pursuing a project—referred to as the Australian Impact
      Exchange project—to develop a public digital marketplace for
      trading debt and equity securities in entities/ assets/funds that
      deliver financial returns and verified environmental and social
      outcomes.</p>

          <p>This Research Brief documents key findings of short-term
      research undertaken by the UNSW Centre for Sustainable Development
      Reform (CSDR) intended to inform the design of AIX pilot projects.
      The Brief addresses the aspects of measuring and verifying the
      performance of different impact dimensions—exploring existing and
      emerging standards, their purpose, scope, and market acceptance,
      and key implications relevant to the AIX project. Consistent with
      the expertise focus of CSDR staff, findings place a greater
      emphasis on nature-related measurement and verification. The
      findings are preliminary and subject to revision based on ongoing
      consultation with relevant DFCRC stakeholders.</p>

          <p>The AIX project seeks to create a marketplace for trading
      securities that deliver verified environmental and social impact
      alongside financial returns. Accurate and credible impact
      measurement and verification are essential for the success of the
      AIX project, as they ensure that investments genuinely contribute
      to sustainability goals. The research will help establish
      standards and frameworks, filling gaps and setting benchmarks that
      enhance transparency, credibility, and market acceptance in
      sustainable finance.</p>

          <p>Socially responsible investing (SRI) encompasses a variety of
      strategies that focus on sustainability objectives alongside
      financial returns. These strategies range from impact investing to
      ESG incorporation and green/blue finance. Each strategy employs
      different objectives and can be applied to asset classes such as
      credits, publicly and privately traded securities, project-level
      initiatives, alternative investments, or other assets.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>5.</label>
          <p>Expanding the scope of the AIX from focusing solely on impact
      investment to include other SRI strategies can enhance its appeal
      and effectiveness. For example, investing in vehicles that employ
      ESG incorporation can encourage best-practice industry leaders by
      integrating ESG factors into financial analysis and investment
      decisions, aligning with standards like the Taskforce on
      Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). At the same time, ESG
      performance strategies can actively engage companies to improve
      their practices and continuously track ESG momentum. Impact
      investing can unlock novel nature-based solutions or encourage
      capital flow towards the circular economy. Green finance can fund
      projects with specific environmental benefits through instruments
      like green and climate bonds, while social finance strategies can
      address pressing social issues through social and impact bonds.
      Governance and ethical strategies, such as active ownership and
      corporate governance investing, can drive corporate change and
      align investments with personal values. Measuring and verifying
      impact refers to the positive environmental or social impacts of
      impact investment.</p>

          <p>Extending beyond impact investments can broaden the scope of
      the AIX and create a tailored approach to assessing and driving
      sustainable development outcomes overall. A comprehensive overview
      of suitable investment strategies to implement in AIX can be found
      in the tables in the Appendix.</p>

      that investments create positive outcomes that would not occur
      otherwise. Impact Investments must align with fiduciary duty and
      social investing, which requires asset managers to act in the best
      interest of beneficiaries and ensure investments align with
      specified social or environmental objectives (Finance UNEP
      Initiative, 2020).</p>

          <p>In contrast, ESG reporting focuses on the broader disclosure of
      an organisation’s environmental, social, and governance practices.
      Standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI),
      Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on
      Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Greenhouse
      Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) help organisations provide transparent
      information on their ESG performance, manage related risks, and
      ensure regulatory compliance. Integrating various strategies
      within AIX could be beneficial to ensure robust impact measurement
      and verification, enhancing credibility and effectiveness in
      driving sustainable development:</p>

          <p>The AIX will need to adhere to the characteristics of each
      asset and strategy to ensure investments deliver verified social
      and environmental outcomes alongside financial returns. The
      assessment should be conducted before investment, with ongoing
      reporting to measure impact during the investment and the use of
      appropriate reporting standards for communicating effect in the

          <p>The landscape of reporting standards, guidance, and measurement
      frameworks is broad and often subject to national regulations,
      legislation, objectives, and approaches. For AIX to ensure that
      investments are financially viable and contribute meaningfully to
      social and environmental goals, it is recommended that this
      landscape be analysed and a comprehensive measurement and
      verification approach be created. Such an approach would require
      developing a “meta” governance structure based on inclusive and
      comprehensive standards.</p>

          <p>A thorough analysis of the measurement and verification
      standards landscape ensures that investments within the AIX
      contribute to social, socio-economic and environmental goals. The
      meta-governance structure should integrate the critical aspects of
      commonly used standards tailored to different socially responsible
      investing strategies. For company reporting, frameworks such as
      the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Taskforce on
      Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the Task Force on
      Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the
      Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) provide essential
      guidelines for companies to report their ESG performance.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>12.</label>
          <p>These guidelines help generate verified scores that can be used
      on the AIX to assess ESG score measurement and verification,
      offering transparency and credibility to investors and helping
      them understand the efficiency and implementation of an ESG-based
      investment strategy. For investor reporting, standards like the UN
      Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), the Global Impact
      Investing Network (GIIN), and the Impact Management Project (IMP)
      guide investors in aligning their strategies with responsible
      investment principles and measuring impact. These standards can be
      leveraged within the AIX marketplace to provide investors with
      precise, standardised data, facilitating informed decision-making
      and ensuring that investments, such as impact investments, meet
      desired social and environmental criteria.</p>

          <p>Regarding GHG emissions, accounting approaches range from VERRA
      and Accounting for Nature to the ISO standards and the EU
      Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Comprehensive ecosystem
      assessments can rely on the System of Environmental-Economic
      Accounting (SEEA), which can build a critical basis for
      integrating more holistic and comprehensive impact assessments.
      While IRIS+ is commonly used to quantify or report qualitatively
      on the impact of impact investments, integrating SEEA can enhance
      the ability to assess broader ecological impacts systematically
      and from a more holistic perspective. Incorporating varied
      frameworks can support the robust and transparent outcome
      measurement and verification of a digital finance exchange, foster
      trust, and attract diverse investors.</p>

            <p>The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a
        framework that integrates environmental and economic data to
        provide a detailed understanding of the interactions between the
        environment and the economy. SEEA is designed to measure the
        stocks and flows of natural resources, including water, forests,
        minerals, and land, as well as the services these resources
        provide. It offers a standardised approach to capturing the
        economic value of natural capital and the costs associated with
        environmental degradation and resource depletion. By linking
        ecological data with economic accounts, SEEA enables
        policymakers, researchers, and environmental managers to assess
        the sustainability of economic activities and make informed
        decisions about resource management and environmental
        conservation.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>18.</label>
            <p>SEEA consists of several components, including physical flow,
        environmental asset, and monetary flow accounts. Physical flow
        accounts track the movement of natural inputs, products, and
        residuals between the environment and the economy. Environmental
        asset accounts monitor the stocks and changes in natural
        resource stocks over time, providing insights into the
        availability and use of resources. Monetary flow accounts record
        the economic transactions related to environmental protection
        and resource management, such as expenditures on pollution
        control and investments in renewable energy. SEEA provides a
        holistic view of how natural capital contributes to economic
        well-being and how economic activities impact the environment.
        This integrated approach makes SEEA a valuable tool for
        assessing the sustainability of development practices,
        evaluating the effectiveness of environmental policies, and
        guiding strategic planning for sustainable development.</p>

            <p>Adopting SEEA as the foundational framework for the AIX
        meta-governance ensures a robust, integrated approach to
        assessing and driving sustainable development outcomes. SEEA
        provides the date to establish a baseline for evaluating the
        effectiveness of impact reporting initiatives such as IRIS+ and
        the Impact Management Project (IMP). These initiatives focus on
        specific impact metrics but can lack a comprehensive perspective
        on broader environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Using SEEA
        as a core conceptual organising framework offers the following
        advantages:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
              <list-item>
                <p>Benchmark Impact Reporting: SEEA’s comprehensive data
            framework on natural resource stocks, flows, and economic
            transactions provide a benchmark against which the impacts
            reported by initiatives like IRIS+ can be compared.</p>

              <list-item>
                <p>Verify Outcomes: SEEA’s standardised framework can be
            used to verify reported impacts, ensuring that they reflect
            real improvements in ecological health and resource
            management. This can help identify discrepancies between
            reported impacts and actual outcomes within ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Understand Holistic Impacts: SEEA’s integration of
            environmental and economic data helps understand how
            specific impacts contribute to broader sustainability goals.
            For instance, while an initiative may report positive social
            impact, SEEA can provide insights into whether these social
            improvements also lead to sustainable environmental outcomes
            and support quantifying those improvements.</p>

                <p>Identify Gaps and Opportunities: By comparing impact
            reports with SEEA data, AIX can identify areas where impact
            initiatives may fall short or overlook critical aspects of
            sustainability. This can guide the deployment of capital
            towards effective impact investment.</p>

            in strategic planning by providing a detailed understanding
            of the interactions between economic activities and natural
            resources. This enables AIX to design investment strategies
            that are both financially viable and environmentally
            sustainable.</p>

            <p>Within the broad range of Environmental, Social and
        Governance (ESG) Reporting Standards, Climate-related disclosure
        and reporting standards, such as the Task Force on
        Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Carbon
        Disclosure Project (CDP), guide companies in presenting
        environmental and social-related information transparently and
        comprehensively in their financial reports and other
        disclosures. These standards are crucial: quantification
        standards ensure accurate emissions data, while disclosure
        standards promote transparency and informed decision-making,
        driving regulatory compliance and market trust. The table below

            <p>IRIS+ provides a comprehensive global catalogue of metrics
        impact investors use to measure social, environmental, and
        financial performance across sectors such as education,
        healthcare, and economic development. SROI translates social
        outcomes into monetary values, offering a method to measure
        social value created by investments in various sectors,
        including community development and healthcare. SPTF focuses on
        assessing social performance in the microfinance sector, while
        BIA evaluates companies’ social and environmental performance,
        emphasising governance, workers, community, environment, and
        customers. IMP provides a consensus on measuring, managing, and
        reporting impacts on people and the planet, covering multiple
        sectors and impact themes.</p>

            <p>Each framework has specific requirements for measurement and
        verification. IRIS+ and IMP emphasise standardised metrics and
        consistent data collection, with third-party audits often used
        for verification. SROI requires detailed data on inputs,
        outputs, and financial proxies, with stakeholder engagement and
        third-party validation. SPTF uses outreach and social
        responsibility indicators, with self-reporting and external
        audits. BIA involves a structured questionnaire and
        comprehensive assessment, verified through third-party audits
        for B Corp certification. The most widely accepted standards
        include IRIS+, IMP, and BIA, which are highly regarded globally
        among impact investors and financial institutions. SROI and SPTF
        are also gaining acceptance, particularly in the non-profit and

        IMP share common elements in defining and standardising impact
        metrics. However, gaps remain in sector-specific metrics for
        niche areas and challenges in assigning monetary values to all
        social outcomes, as seen with SROI. Understanding these overlaps
        and gaps is crucial for developing a comprehensive and credible

        specific to certain regions due to factors like regulatory
        requirements, which entail adherence to local laws and policies.
        Market acceptance varies by region and is influenced by local
        stakeholder expectations and economic contexts. This regional

            <p>Standards for measuring ecological health are essential for
        protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services.
        The frameworks focus on assessing and reporting the condition of
        natural assets such as soils, vegetation, and fauna. The
        following paragraphs introduces various ecological health
        standards and compares them, analysing their purpose, scope,
        market acceptance, strengths, and weaknesses to highlight their
        roles in impact measurement.</p>

            <p>Accounting for Nature is a framework designed to measure and
        report the condition of environmental assets, offering a
        standardised approach to assessing ecosystem health. It
        encompasses a wide range of natural resources, providing data to
        support informed decision-making in environmental management.
        Its science-based methodology aims to enhance the understanding
        and conservation of ecosystems, aligning with global
        environmental policies.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>31.</label>
            <p>The framework offers extensive geographic coverage, which
        applies to diverse ecosystems globally, from tropical
        rainforests to arid landscapes. Its sectoral coverage spans
        agriculture, forestry, conservation, and urban planning,
        providing a tool for various environmental management practices.
        The framework’s impact coverage includes a wide range of
        ecological assets, such as soils, vegetation, and fauna,
        ensuring a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>32.</label>
            <p>The framework employs a set of measurement and verification
        requirements to ensure accurate and reliable ecological
        assessments. Environmental Condition Accounts (ECA) and the
        Environmental Condition Index (Econd®), which ranges from 0 to
        100, quantify the state of environmental assets. Indicators must
        be scientifically validated, and detailed data collection
        instructions ensure consistency. Reference condition benchmarks
        represent the asset’s natural or best possible state.
        Verification involves independent audits by accredited experts
        to provide methods and data that meet stringent criteria. The
        framework specifies accuracy levels (95%, 90%, or 80%) to
        indicate precision, with higher levels requiring more detailed
        methods. Transparency is maintained through complete
        documentation of data sources, methodologies, and calculations.
        Continuous improvement processes ensure the framework
        incorporates new scientific knowledge and enhances robustness
        over time.</p>

            <p>The Natural Capital
        Protocol<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref> is a framework
        for assessing and valuing natural capital impacts and
        dependencies. It is divided into four stages: Frame, Scope,
        Measure and Value, and Apply. The Frame stage helps stakeholders
        understand the importance of evaluating natural capital and
        introduces them to key concepts. This stage involves preparing
        for the assessment by understanding the context and objectives
        and identifying the relevant stakeholders. The Scope stage
        defines the assessment’s objectives and boundaries and
        identifies the relevant natural capital impacts and
        dependencies. This stage sets the parameters for what will be
        assessed, including the geographical and temporal scope and the
        specific impacts and dependencies.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>34.</label>
            <p>The Measure and Value stage quantifies and values the
        identified impacts and dependencies using qualitative,
        quantitative, and monetary methods. This involves collecting
        data, applying appropriate valuation techniques, and calculating
        the overall impact on natural capital. Both biophysical
        measurement and economic valuation are used to provide a
        comprehensive assessment. The Apply stage interprets the
        results, validates their accuracy, and integrates them into
        decision-making processes. This involves analysing the results,
        assessing the financial and environmental implications, and
        communicating the findings to stakeholders.</p>

            <p>Several factors are considered when classifying standards
        according to their widespread acceptance. Accounting for Nature,
        for example, is an emerging framework primarily developed with a
        focus on Australia, though it is expanding globally. Its
        adoption and integration into business and policy processes are
        still gaining traction. Many organisations and countries are in
        the early stages of implementing this framework, testing its
        methodologies, and assessing its practicality and effectiveness.
        The same can be said about its relevance in impact
        assessment.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, the Natural Capital Protocol is widely
        accepted, having been developed through collaboration with
        multiple global organisations. It has been broadly adopted by
        businesses and industries worldwide, encouraging integration
        with existing business reporting frameworks such as financial
        and sustainability reporting. This widespread recognition and
        endorsement by international organisations has led to its higher
        degree of acceptance and implementation.</p>

            <p>Accounting for Nature emphasises measuring the condition of
        environmental assets with a standardised approach to ecological
        health metrics. While this focus is valuable, it can limit
        broader application until further refinement and validation
        across diverse contexts. In contrast, the Natural Capital
        Protocol offers comprehensive impact measurement, assessing
        business impacts on natural capital across all industries and
        geographies. This approach to identifying, measuring, and
        valuing natural capital impacts makes it more adaptable and
        relevant for many businesses.</p>

          <p>The impact investing market has seen significant growth, with
      more investors seeking investments that align with their values
      while offering competitive returns. The growing awareness of
      global challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and
      biodiversity loss drives this trend. Pension funds and
      institutional investors increasingly commit substantial capital to
      sustainable investments, directing more funds toward energy
      transition and other impact-focused initiatives. For instance, the
      California Public Employees’ Retirement System recently announced
      a $100 billion commitment toward climate solutions by 2030, moving
      its portfolio closer to net zero. The New York State Common
      Retirement Fund also doubled its sustainable investment commitment
      to $40 billion to protect state pensions from climate risk. In
      Europe, many investors commit percentages of their investment
      portfolio to Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)
      Article 9 funds, which must fulfil specific requirements to be
      classified as sustainable (Eisenberg and Plakalo
      (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

          <p>The European market has witnessed a rise in specialised impact
      funds, with established investment firms launching new products to
      address specific environmental and social challenges. British
      global investment firm Permira launched its first energy
      transition fund, and private equity company EQT closed its EQT
      Future Fund, the most significant impact fund ever raised in
      private markets. Additionally, private equity firms Ardian,
      Eurazeo, and Tikehau have launched nature, biodiversity, and other
      specialised funds focused on clean hydrogen, sustainable
      agriculture, and energy transition funds in credit, real estate,
      and other underpenetrated asset classes. As these funds deploy
      more capital and demonstrate a track record, the industry
      continues to grow, offering more directed and specific solutions
      for limited partners. This mobilises substantial capital toward
      innovative solutions that address pressing environmental and
      social challenges (Eisenberg and Plakalo
      (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>43.</label>
          <p>Infrastructure investments have also drawn significant
      attention, with some of the largest US-based general partners and
      investors focusing on energy transition platforms. Firms like
      Brookfield, TPG Rise Climate, Apollo, Ares, Blackstone, and KKR
      have all announced new energy transition funds and commitments to
      energy transition investments over the past year. This
      consolidation among general partners is led primarily by large
      managers responding to their limited partners’ interest in
      increasing commitments to positive impact through infrastructure
      and impact investments. According to the GIIN, the five most
      considerable impact investing general partners accounted for 47%
      of the total assets under management in the impact investment
      market. Since last May, several top private equity firms have
      acquired infrastructure investing capabilities, offering a broader
      range of strategies to limited partners and bringing new energy
      transition competencies into their firms (Eisenberg and Plakalo
      (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

          <p>Impact investing in Asia is experiencing significant growth,
      driven by the need for financial support for expanding businesses
      and addressing social and environmental challenges. Over the past
      15 years, particularly in Southeast Asia, impact investments have
      surged, with investors committing over two-thirds of the total
      capital from 2007–2016 in just the last three years (2020-2022).
      This growth includes a 40% increase in investment and projects
      compared to the previous three years. Development finance
      institutions have also maintained annual investments of around
      US$2 billion over the past six years. Despite these positive
      trends, challenges remain, such as bridging the funding gap for
      early-stage businesses and ensuring investments address issues
      like greenhouse gas emissions, gender equality, and aging
      populations. Initiatives like USAID’s ESG program in Vietnam
      highlight efforts to promote sustainable growth, supporting small
      and growing businesses crucial to the country’s socio-economic
      development and environmental sustainability. This expanding
      market encourages Asian companies to prioritise sustainability and
      social responsibility, benefiting investors and the broader
      community (Richter

            <p>Market growth trends can give us an understanding of impact
        dimensions that face increased scrutiny. For example, one
        significant dimension is the increasing focus on climate
        resilience and energy transition. With institutional investors
        like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System
        committing substantial capital toward climate solutions, there
        is a clear shift towards investments that offer financial
        returns and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
        enhancing climate resilience. The emergence of specialised funds
        dedicated to clean hydrogen, sustainable agriculture, and
        renewable energy highlights this trend. The commitment to energy
        transition is further evidenced by the launch of new energy
        transition funds by firms such as Brookfield, TPG Rise Climate,
        and Apollo (Eisenberg and Plakalo

            <label>46.</label>
            <p>The alignment of investments with social and equity values is
        becoming a critical consideration for impact investors. This
        trend is driven by recognising the importance of addressing
        social determinants of health and well-being, as well as the
        need for inclusive economic growth. The rise of Sustainable
        Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Article 9 funds in Europe,
        which require strict adherence to sustainability criteria,
        reflects a growing demand for investments that promote social
        equity and address systemic inequalities (Eisenberg and Plakalo
        (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

          <list-item>
            <label>47.</label>
            <p>Social equity and inclusion have also gained increased
        scrutiny and importance among impact investors in the
        Asia-Pacific region. According to the report “Advancing Impact:
        A Road Map for Social Investing in Asia,” several key trends
        have emerged. There is a growing emphasis on gender equality and
        women’s empowerment, with investments targeting female
        entrepreneurs and women-led businesses. Initiatives like
        Indonesia’s Ojek Syari, a female-only ride-hailing service,
        illustrate how social investments can address both economic
        empowerment and safety for women. Additionally, there is a focus
        on improving health and education outcomes in underserved
        communities. Investments in nutrition supplement companies in
        China and educational programs in rural India highlight
        commitment to addressing fundamental social determinants of
        health and education disparities. Furthermore, the report
        emphasises the importance of local context and stakeholder
        engagement in designing and implementing social investment
        projects, ensuring that interventions are culturally appropriate
        and have the support of the communities they aim to serve (The
        Economist Group
        (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-economist2022" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>48.</label>
            <p>Other aspects under the social dimension include the impact
        of best practices on work environments. Certifications such as
        “Great Place to Work” and adherence to the Global Compact
        principles highlight the importance of ethical business
        practices, employee well-being, and corporate social
        responsibility. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is
        another critical tool that helps investors assess and address
        the multifaceted nature of poverty, ensuring that investments
        contribute to reducing deprivation in areas such as health,
        education, and living standards. These frameworks and
        certifications not only improve the quality of work environments
        but also promote broader social goals, aligning business
        practices with the pursuit of inclusive and sustainable
        development.</p>

            <label>49.</label>
            <p>The need for a comprehensive and interconnected approach to
        impact assessment has become increasingly critical in recent
        years. Published reports by the (European Commission
        (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-ec2023" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>))
        and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (2023)
        highlight evolving trends that emphasise integrating a holistic
        ecosystem perspective within national and international nature
        targets. Adopting this approach is essential when addressing
        issues like “impact washing” and enhancing impact measurement
        and verification processes. Accounting frameworks like
        Accounting for Nature, the Natural Capital Protocol, Taskforce
        on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and SEEA
        emphasise a comprehensive view of ecosystems and stress their
        interconnectedness, where sustainable development depends on
        multilayered and interrelated aspects. Such frameworks help
        identify synergies and trade-offs within ecosystems, ensuring
        that the diverse services of nature are accurately evaluated and
        appreciated.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>50.</label>
            <p>Implementing nature-based accounting standards (NCA) is
        crucial to addressing impact washing. Holistic NCAs utilise
        detailed measurement standards that capture an aggregate range
        of environmental impacts. This thorough approach reduces the
        likelihood of overstating or falsely claiming benefits within
        impact investment. Impact washing deals with wrongly depicting
        the effects of investments, often by focusing solely on positive
        outcomes while neglecting negative impacts. As noted by Bendell
        (2019), we can only ensure we achieve our intended net societal
        and environmental benefits if we measure and manage both
        positive and negative outcomes. This requires a comprehensive
        impact assessment approach, integrating multi-dimensional
        metrics to provide an honest and accurate evaluation of
        investments. By adhering to rigorous, science-based frameworks
        such as NCAs, stakeholders can maintain transparency and
        accountability, ensuring that investments contribute genuinely
        to sustainable development goals and avoid the pitfalls of
        misleading impact claims. The United Nations Office for Disaster
        Risk Reduction (2023) report emphasises the importance of
        recognising co-benefits of nature-based solutions, such as
        biodiversity conservation, climate regulation, and improved
        human well-being. This aligns with ecosystem accounting
        principles, which advocate measuring and valuing multiple
        ecosystem services based on asset condition and extent
        assessments to inform decision-making. The implication is that
        impact assessments should focus on more than just single
        outcomes and capture the interconnected benefits and trade-offs
        of environmental investments.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>51.</label>
            <p>Second, stakeholders can avoid impact washing using
        frameworks like Accounting for Nature, the Natural Capital
        Protocol, or SEEA by ensuring that all relevant environmental
        services and ecosystem interconnections are considered through
        science-based metrics. This prevents the narrow focus on single
        metrics, which can be misleading, easily manipulated, or
        diminish impact returns. Instead, the frameworks can provide
        multi-dimensional views of impact, highlighting both positive
        outcomes and potential negative trade-offs within ecosystems
        and, therefore, impact outcomes. The report of the European
        Commission (2023) emphasises that the credibility and accuracy
        of impact assessments are heavily dependent on the quality and
        scientific rigour of the metrics used.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>52.</label>
            <p>Finally, the European Commission’s report (2023) emphasises
        the importance of considering spatial and temporal scales in
        impact assessments, acknowledging that nature-based solutions
        can have varying impacts over different geographic areas and
        timeframes. Additionally, the report highlights the importance
        of engaging stakeholders and considering the socio-economic
        context in designing and assessing nature-based solutions. These
        considerations stress the need for robust natural accounting
        frameworks that incorporate and promote continuous monitoring
        and rigorous assessment to ensure accurate and comprehensive
        evaluations. Integrating spatial, temporal, and socio-economic
        factors, nature accounting frameworks can help mitigate impact
        washing by ensuring that investments are transparently and
        accurately measured, managed and reported. A comprehensive
        approach enables the alignment of investment capital more

            <p>A well-established dimension in impact investing focuses on
        efforts to preserve environmental health through sustainable
        resource management. This dimension encompasses innovation and
        controls on waste and other sources of pollution, and on water
        and other resources management, all of which are vital for
        public health and community well-being. The global increase in
        waste production has driven the need for advanced waste
        management solutions, including recycling technologies and
        waste-to-energy systems. According to the United Nations
        Environment Programme (UNEP), these innovations help reduce the
        environmental footprint and promote resource efficiency (UNEP,
        2021). Standards and certifications such as Zero Waste to
        Landfill and tools like LCA (Lifecycle Assessments) are
        continuously growing in adoption. Similarly, impact investors
        are increasingly supporting initiatives that tackle other
        pollution controls, including efforts to reduce air, noise, and
        water pollution, all linked to severe health issues and
        environmental degradation (World Health Organization, 2018).
        Initiatives include those that develop cleaner industrial
        processes, emissions reduction technologies, and sustainable
        agricultural practices, among others. These investments are
        crucial in addressing the adverse effects of pollutants on
        communities, particularly in densely populated urban areas where
        air quality concerns are most acute, and on the oceans
        (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>54.</label>
            <p>Water management also plays a vital role in this dimension,
        particularly in regions facing water scarcity and contamination
        challenges. Investments are being directed toward improving
        water infrastructure, promoting water conservation technologies,
        and developing systems for better water quality monitoring and
        management. These efforts are essential in ensuring access to
        clean and safe water, which is fundamental to public health and
        economic development (World Resources Institute, 2020). At a
        corporate scale, frameworks, standards, and even credit schemes
        such as the Water Footprint, ISO 14046: Environmental
        Management-Water Footprint, LEED Water Efficiency credits, and
        the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard are also
        growing in demand and requirements as water scarcity becomes a
        more pressing issue globally (International Organization for
        Standardization
        (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-iso2018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>)).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>55.</label>
            <p>The emphasis on environmental health through sustainable
        resource management is further reflected as a whole in
        regulatory frameworks and global standards. For instance, the
        European Union’s Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan
        promote sustainable production and consumption patterns,
        encouraging investments that align with these goals. Moreover,
        international agreements like the Paris Agreement highlight the
        interconnectedness of environmental health and climate action,
        underscoring the need for integrated approaches to address these
        issues (European Commission, 2019; United Nations Framework
        Convention on Climate Change, 2015). In that sense, as
        previously mentioned, frameworks such as GRI, ISO 14001, and B
        Corp Certification promote environmental management practices by
        helping organizations minimize their environmental footprint,
        comply with applicable laws and regulations, and continually
        improve their environmental performance (Global Reporting
        Initiative
        (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-gri2021" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>56.</label>
            <p>By prioritizing investments in environmental practices such
        as waste management, pollution control, and water management,
        impact investors can contribute to significant environmental and
        social benefits. These include improved public health outcomes,
        enhanced resilience to environmental changes, and the promotion
        of sustainable development. As awareness of these issues grows,
        the demand for solutions that address environmental health and
        sustainable resource management will likely continue to rise,
        making this an increasingly important dimension in the impact
        investment landscape.</p>

          <label>57.</label>
          <p>The Australian and global marketplace for nature-related
      frameworks and standards in undergoing rapid evolution and is far
      from a state of maturity. Different frameworks and standards have
      highly heterogenous subject matter scopes and methodological
      design. This complicates any assessment of trade-offs between
      different exchange design choices, and creates risks of adverse
      consequences and path dependencies if premature choices are made
      to adopt certain methods, frameworks or standards.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>58.</label>
          <p>Another complicating factor is the fundamental uncertainty
      concerning the scope of assets intended for listing on the
      proposed AIX. Establishing public exchanges based on verified
      environmental and social outcomes (“Impact Exchanges”) involves
      careful design choices—about the specific measurement and
      verification methods, frameworks and standards that determine
      market disclosures. These design choices depend fundamentally on
      the scope of assets or instruments that can be traded—for example
      Impact Exchanges focused on:</p>
          <p>– corporate securities might be best underpinned by holistic
      disclosure frameworks such as those maintained by the Capitals
      Coalition (e.g. the Natural Capital Protocol), or Taskforces for
      Nature-Related, and Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD
      and TCFD respectively).</p>
          <p>– enabling impact investment might be best underpinned by the
      existing dedicated frameworks such as Global Impact Investing
      Network’s (GIIN) IRIS+, the Social Return on Investment (SROI),
      the Social Performance Task Force (SPTF), B Impact Assessment
      (BIA) by B Lab, and the Impact Management Project (IMP).</p>
          <p>– commodities or real property may be well matched with primary
      low-level measurement frameworks such as those developed for
      specific sectoral raw material supply chains (e.g. apparel,
      minerals and metals, etc), or environmental characteristics
      (e.g. pollution levels, in-situ biodiversity).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>59.</label>
          <p>An alternative approach for AIX to consider is to adopt
      “meta-standards” that establish key priorities and principles
      (transparency, methodological replicability, clarity of scope and
      focus, etc) for disclosure of all nature-related frameworks and
      standards utilised by assets traded on the exchange. This approach
      has analogies in other fast-moving sectors (e.g. telecommunication
      regulation) and could ensure a balance between flexible
      innovation, coherent methodological specialisation for specific
      traded asset classes, and investor requirements.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>60.</label>
          <p>Further research is needed to establish and stress test the
      specific principles and requirements that would be incorporated
      into the “meta-standard” for environmental and social metrics.
      Some candidate principles are summarised below:</p>
          <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p>Principle 1: Traded assets should disclose both their
          primary environmental and social outcomes (quantified or
          qualified as appropriate) and the methodological basis for
          assessing those outcomes.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Principle 2: The disclosed methodological basis for
          disclosure should be compatible with certain quality standards
          intended to support alignment with general fiduciary
          principles and Australian consumer regulation. They
          should:</p>
              <list list-type="bullet">
                <list-item>
                  <p>(2A) Transparently document their definitional
              foundations, input data and assessment methods. Low-level
              environmental definitions should be aligned with the SEEA
              as appropriate, in particular to avoid confusion between
              measurement of environmental stocks (e.g. the extent
              and/or condition of specific ecosystem types aligned to
              the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology) and flows of goods and
              services from the environment to the economy (e.g. carbon
              sequestration, regulation of waste, flows of raw
              materials).</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>(2B) Clearly document their functional, geographical
              and value chain scope coverage (e.g. 1+2 vs 3) and use
              pre-defined categories aligned to the SEEA and other
              relevant global statistical standards.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
            </list-item>
          </list>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>61.</label>
          <p>We also suggest that a standing technical committee should be
      incorporated into the governance planning for the AIX with a clear
      remit to iteratively refine and develop meta-standards concerning
      social and environmental outcome disclosure, and facilitate
      pre-competitive dialogue between different frameworks, standards
      and approaches.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <label>62.</label>
          <p>A pragmatic alternative to the “meta-standards” approach
      suggested above would be to establish an Impact Exchange based on
      clear social and environmental outcome metrics for which there is
      short-term market demand, regardless of asset class. One advantage
      of this approach is the ability to generate liquidity and positive
      margins that could be reinvested into improving and scaling the
      Impact Exchange. A key risk is that metrics may evolve in response
      to ad-hoc demand drivers without sufficient attention to
      generating the coherence, robustness and transparency needed to
      bring investment in environmental and social outcomes to scale.
      The fundamental structural deficiencies of both voluntary and
      statutory carbon markets identified in recent years offers a
      pertinent cautionary tale.</p>

      <abstract>
Impact Exchanges require distinct measurement frameworks across asset
classes (corporate securities, impact investments, commodities) due to
fundamental differences in how environmental and social outcomes are
quantified, verified, and reported within each market segment. We
propose use of a “meta-standards” approach for incorporating measurement
of environmental and social outcomes—establishing overarching principles
for outcome measurement while allowing methodological flexibility -
supported by a technical committee to ensure market integrity and
framework interoperability. Short-term market demands for simple metrics
must be balanced against systemic risks, as evidenced by carbon markets
where inadequate standardization and verification led to market
fragmentation and credibility issues.

            <p>Measurement and verification of environmental and social
      outcomes to inform financial investment is a rapidly evolving
      field. A wide variety of measurement and verification methods are
      currently used to assess the environmental and social performance
      of diverse financial instruments for diverse asset classes. These
      methods are commonly applied as a subset of overarching frameworks
      and standards implementation—for positive and negative
      environmental, social and governance (ESG) screening, impact
      investment, corporate disclosure of impacts and dependencies,
      sustainability certification or benchmarking, and other topic
      areas. These frameworks and standards are characterised by highly
      varied degrees of: formal standardisation, public or private

      focused on:</p>

          developed for specific sectoral raw material supply chains
          (e.g. apparel, minerals and metals, etc), or environmental
          characteristics (e.g. pollution levels, in-situ
          biodiversity).</p>

            <p>Predicating an Impact Exchange on specific primary outcome
      methods is fraught with risk—the Australian and global political
      economy for environmental and social measurement, verification,
      and reporting in characterised by rapid innovation and is far from
      a state of maturity. Different frameworks and standards have
      highly heterogenous subject matter scopes, methodological design
      and underlying commercial or values-based imperatives. This
      complicates any assessment of trade-offs between different
      exchange design choices, and creates risks of adverse consequences
      and path dependencies if premature choices are made to adopt
      certain methods, frameworks or standards.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>In the near term, we recommend a “meta-standards” approach to
      the design of the proposed Australian Impact Exchange (AIX) that
      focuses on preserving market integrity through transparent,
      principles-based and market-driven evolution of methods for
      measurement and verification of environmental and social outcomes.
      Some candidate principles, which would benefit from further
      consultation and research, are summarised below:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
              <list-item>
                <p>Principle 1: Traded assets should disclose both their
          primary environmental and social outcomes (quantified or
          qualified as appropriate) and the methodological basis for
          assessing those outcomes.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>Principle 2: The disclosed methodological basis for

                    <p>Transparently document their definitional foundations,
              input data and assessment methods. Low-level definitions
              should be aligned with the System of
              Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) as appropriate,
              in particular to avoid confusion between measurement of
              environmental stocks (e.g. the extent and/or condition of
              specific ecosystem types aligned to the IUCN Global
              Ecosystem Typology) and flows of goods and services from
              the environment to the economy (e.g. carbon sequestration,
              regulation of waste, flows of raw materials)–see Figure 1
              below.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Clearly document their functional, geographical and
              value chain scope coverage (e.g. 1+2 vs 3) and use

          <list-item>
            <p>We also suggest that a standing technical committee should be
      incorporated into the governance planning for the AIX with a clear
      remit to iteratively refine and develop meta-standards concerning
      social and environmental outcome disclosure, and facilitate
      pre-competitive dialogue between different frameworks, standards
      and approaches.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>A pragmatic alternative to the “meta-standards” approach
      suggested above would be to establish an Impact Exchange based on
      clear social and environmental outcome metrics for which there is
      short-term market demand. One advantage of this approach is the
      ability to generate liquidity and positive margins that could be
      reinvested into improving and scaling the Impact Exchange. A key
      risk is that metrics may evolve in response to ad hoc demand
      drivers without sufficient attention to generating the coherence,
      robustness and transparency needed to bring investment in
      environmental and social outcomes to scale. The fundamental
      structural deficiencies of both voluntary and statutory carbon
      markets identified in recent years offers a pertinent cautionary
      tale.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-nb-article">1</xref></p>

            <p>The AIX project seeks to create a marketplace for trading
      securities that deliver verified environmental and social impact
      alongside financial returns. Accurate and credible impact
      measurement and verification are essential for the success of the
      AIX project, as they ensure that investments genuinely contribute
      to sustainability goals. The research will help establish
      standards and frameworks, filling gaps and setting benchmarks that
      enhance transparency, credibility, and market acceptance in
      sustainable finance.</p>

          <list-item>
            <label>4.</label>
            <p>Socially responsible investing (SRI) encompasses a variety of
      strategies that focus on sustainability objectives alongside
      financial returns. These strategies range from impact investing to
      ESG incorporation and green/blue finance. Each strategy employs
      different objectives and can be applied to asset classes such as
      credits, publicly and privately traded securities, project-level
      initiatives, alternative investments, or other assets.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>5.</label>
            <p>Expanding the scope of the AIX from focusing solely on impact
      investment to include other SRI strategies can enhance its appeal
      and effectiveness. For example, investing in vehicles that employ
      ESG incorporation can encourage best-practice industry leaders by
      integrating ESG factors into financial analysis and investment
      decisions, aligning with standards like the Taskforce on
      Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). At the same time, ESG
      performance strategies can actively engage companies to improve
      their practices and continuously track ESG momentum. Impact
      investing can unlock novel nature-based solutions or encourage
      capital flow towards the circular economy. Green finance can fund
      projects with specific environmental benefits through instruments
      like green and climate bonds, while social finance strategies can
      address pressing social issues through social and impact bonds.
      Governance and ethical strategies, such as active ownership and
      corporate governance investing, can drive corporate change and
      align investments with personal values. Measuring and verifying
      impact refers to the positive environmental or social impacts of
      impact investment.</p>

            <p>Extending beyond impact investments can broaden the scope of
      the AIX and create a tailored approach to assessing and driving
      sustainable development outcomes overall. A comprehensive overview

      evidence-based<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-nb-article">5</xref>, ensuring
      that investments create positive outcomes that would not occur
      otherwise. Impact Investments must align with fiduciary duty and
      social investing, which requires asset managers to act in the best
      interest of beneficiaries and ensure investments align with
      specified social or environmental objectives (Finance UNEP
      Initiative, 2020).</p>

            <p>In contrast, ESG reporting focuses on the broader disclosure of
      an organisation’s environmental, social, and governance practices.
      Standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI),
      Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on
      Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Greenhouse
      Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) help organisations provide transparent
      information on their ESG performance, manage related risks, and
      ensure regulatory compliance. Integrating various strategies
      within AIX could be beneficial to ensure robust impact measurement
      and verification, enhancing credibility and effectiveness in

            <p>The AIX will need to adhere to the characteristics of each
      asset and strategy to ensure investments deliver verified social
      and environmental outcomes alongside financial returns. The
      assessment should be conducted before investment, with ongoing
      reporting to measure impact during the investment and the use of
      appropriate reporting standards for communicating effect in the

            <p>The landscape of reporting standards, guidance, and measurement
      frameworks is broad and often subject to national regulations,
      legislation, objectives, and approaches. For AIX to ensure that
      investments are financially viable and contribute meaningfully to
      social and environmental goals, it is recommended that this
      landscape be analysed and a comprehensive measurement and
      verification approach be created. Such an approach would require
      developing a “meta” governance structure based on inclusive and
      comprehensive standards.</p>

            <p>A thorough analysis of the measurement and verification
      standards landscape ensures that investments within the AIX
      contribute to social, socio-economic and environmental goals. The
      meta-governance structure should integrate the critical aspects of
      commonly used standards tailored to different socially responsible
      investing strategies. For company reporting, frameworks such as
      the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Taskforce on
      Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the Task Force on
      Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the

            <p>These guidelines help generate verified scores that can be used
      on the AIX to assess ESG score measurement and verification,
      offering transparency and credibility to investors and helping
      them understand the efficiency and implementation of an ESG-based
      investment strategy. For investor reporting, standards like the UN
      Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), the Global Impact
      Investing Network (GIIN), and the Impact Management Project (IMP)
      guide investors in aligning their strategies with responsible
      investment principles and measuring impact. These standards can be
      leveraged within the AIX marketplace to provide investors with
      precise, standardised data, facilitating informed decision-making
      and ensuring that investments, such as impact investments, meet
      desired social and environmental criteria.</p>

            <p>Regarding GHG emissions, accounting approaches range from VERRA
      and Accounting for Nature to the ISO standards and the EU
      Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Comprehensive ecosystem
      assessments can rely on the System of Environmental-Economic
      Accounting (SEEA), which can build a critical basis for
      integrating more holistic and comprehensive impact assessments.
      While IRIS+ is commonly used to quantify or report qualitatively
      on the impact of impact investments, integrating SEEA can enhance
      the ability to assess broader ecological impacts systematically
      and from a more holistic perspective. Incorporating varied
      frameworks can support the robust and transparent outcome
      measurement and verification of a digital finance exchange, foster
      trust, and attract diverse investors.</p>

              <p>The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a
        framework that integrates environmental and economic data to
        provide a detailed understanding of the interactions between the
        environment and the economy. SEEA is designed to measure the
        stocks and flows of natural resources, including water, forests,
        minerals, and land, as well as the services these resources
        provide. It offers a standardised approach to capturing the
        economic value of natural capital and the costs associated with
        environmental degradation and resource depletion. By linking
        ecological data with economic accounts, SEEA enables
        policymakers, researchers, and environmental managers to assess
        the sustainability of economic activities and make informed
        decisions about resource management and environmental
        conservation.</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>18.</label>
              <p>SEEA consists of several components, including physical flow,
        environmental asset, and monetary flow accounts. Physical flow
        accounts track the movement of natural inputs, products, and
        residuals between the environment and the economy. Environmental
        asset accounts monitor the stocks and changes in natural
        resource stocks over time, providing insights into the
        availability and use of resources. Monetary flow accounts record
        the economic transactions related to environmental protection
        and resource management, such as expenditures on pollution
        control and investments in renewable energy. SEEA provides a
        holistic view of how natural capital contributes to economic
        well-being and how economic activities impact the environment.
        This integrated approach makes SEEA a valuable tool for
        assessing the sustainability of development practices,
        evaluating the effectiveness of environmental policies, and
        guiding strategic planning for sustainable development.</p>

              <p>Adopting SEEA as the foundational framework for the AIX
        meta-governance ensures a robust, integrated approach to
        assessing and driving sustainable development outcomes. SEEA
        provides the date to establish a baseline for evaluating the
        effectiveness of impact reporting initiatives such as IRIS+ and
        the Impact Management Project (IMP). These initiatives focus on

            framework on natural resource stocks, flows, and economic

              <p>Within the broad range of Environmental, Social and
        Governance (ESG) Reporting Standards, Climate-related disclosure
        and reporting standards, such as the Task Force on
        Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Carbon
        Disclosure Project (CDP), guide companies in presenting
        environmental and social-related information transparently and

              <p>IRIS+ provides a comprehensive global catalogue of metrics
        impact investors use to measure social, environmental, and
        financial performance across sectors such as education,
        healthcare, and economic development. SROI translates social
        outcomes into monetary values, offering a method to measure
        social value created by investments in various sectors,
        including community development and healthcare. SPTF focuses on
        assessing social performance in the microfinance sector, while
        BIA evaluates companies’ social and environmental performance,
        emphasising governance, workers, community, environment, and
        customers. IMP provides a consensus on measuring, managing, and
        reporting impacts on people and the planet, covering multiple
        sectors and impact themes.</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>24.</label>
              <p>Each framework has specific requirements for measurement and
        verification. IRIS+ and IMP emphasise standardised metrics and
        consistent data collection, with third-party audits often used
        for verification. SROI requires detailed data on inputs,
        outputs, and financial proxies, with stakeholder engagement and
        third-party validation. SPTF uses outreach and social
        responsibility indicators, with self-reporting and external
        audits. BIA involves a structured questionnaire and
        comprehensive assessment, verified through third-party audits
        for B Corp certification. The most widely accepted standards
        include IRIS+, IMP, and BIA, which are highly regarded globally
        among impact investors and financial institutions. SROI and SPTF
        are also gaining acceptance, particularly in the non-profit and
        microfinance sectors.</p>

              <p>Despite their wide acceptance, these frameworks often overlap
        in their methodologies and objectives. For example, IRIS+ and
        IMP share common elements in defining and standardising impact
        metrics. However, gaps remain in sector-specific metrics for
        niche areas and challenges in assigning monetary values to all
        social outcomes, as seen with SROI. Understanding these overlaps
        and gaps is crucial for developing a comprehensive and credible
        impact assessment strategy, ensuring investments align with
        broader social and environmental goals.</p>

              <p>The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and ISO 14064 are

        requirements, which entail adherence to local laws and policies.
        Market acceptance varies by region and is influenced by local

              <p>Standards for measuring ecological health are essential for
        protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services.
        The frameworks focus on assessing and reporting the condition of
        natural assets such as soils, vegetation, and fauna. The
        following paragraphs introduces various ecological health
        standards and compares them, analysing their purpose, scope,
        market acceptance, strengths, and weaknesses to highlight their
        roles in impact measurement.</p>

              <p>Accounting for Nature is a framework designed to measure and
        report the condition of environmental assets, offering a
        standardised approach to assessing ecosystem health. It
        encompasses a wide range of natural resources, providing data to
        support informed decision-making in environmental management.
        Its science-based methodology aims to enhance the understanding
        and conservation of ecosystems, aligning with global
        environmental policies.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <label>31.</label>
              <p>The framework offers extensive geographic coverage, which
        applies to diverse ecosystems globally, from tropical
        rainforests to arid landscapes. Its sectoral coverage spans
        agriculture, forestry, conservation, and urban planning,
        providing a tool for various environmental management practices.
        The framework’s impact coverage includes a wide range of
        ecological assets, such as soils, vegetation, and fauna,
        ensuring a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health.</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>32.</label>
              <p>The framework employs a set of measurement and verification
        requirements to ensure accurate and reliable ecological
        assessments. Environmental Condition Accounts (ECA) and the
        Environmental Condition Index (Econd®), which ranges from 0 to
        100, quantify the state of environmental assets. Indicators must
        be scientifically validated, and detailed data collection
        instructions ensure consistency. Reference condition benchmarks
        represent the asset’s natural or best possible state.
        Verification involves independent audits by accredited experts
        to provide methods and data that meet stringent criteria. The
        framework specifies accuracy levels (95%, 90%, or 80%) to
        indicate precision, with higher levels requiring more detailed
        methods. Transparency is maintained through complete
        documentation of data sources, methodologies, and calculations.
        Continuous improvement processes ensure the framework
        incorporates new scientific knowledge and enhances robustness
        over time.</p>

              <p>The Natural Capital
        Protocol<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-nb-article">6</xref> is a framework
        for assessing and valuing natural capital impacts and
        dependencies. It is divided into four stages: Frame, Scope,
        Measure and Value, and Apply. The Frame stage helps stakeholders
        understand the importance of evaluating natural capital and
        introduces them to key concepts. This stage involves preparing
        for the assessment by understanding the context and objectives
        and identifying the relevant stakeholders. The Scope stage
        defines the assessment’s objectives and boundaries and
        identifies the relevant natural capital impacts and
        dependencies. This stage sets the parameters for what will be
        assessed, including the geographical and temporal scope and the
        specific impacts and dependencies.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <label>34.</label>
              <p>The Measure and Value stage quantifies and values the
        identified impacts and dependencies using qualitative,
        quantitative, and monetary methods. This involves collecting
        data, applying appropriate valuation techniques, and calculating
        the overall impact on natural capital. Both biophysical
        measurement and economic valuation are used to provide a
        comprehensive assessment. The Apply stage interprets the
        results, validates their accuracy, and integrates them into
        decision-making processes. This involves analysing the results,
        assessing the financial and environmental implications, and
        communicating the findings to stakeholders.</p>

              <p>Several factors are considered when classifying standards
        according to their widespread acceptance. Accounting for Nature,
        for example, is an emerging framework primarily developed with a
        focus on Australia, though it is expanding globally. Its
        adoption and integration into business and policy processes are
        still gaining traction. Many organisations and countries are in
        the early stages of implementing this framework, testing its
        methodologies, and assessing its practicality and effectiveness.
        The same can be said about its relevance in impact
        assessment.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, the Natural Capital Protocol is widely
        accepted, having been developed through collaboration with
        multiple global organisations. It has been broadly adopted by
        businesses and industries worldwide, encouraging integration
        with existing business reporting frameworks such as financial
        and sustainability reporting. This widespread recognition and
        endorsement by international organisations has led to its higher
        degree of acceptance and implementation.</p>

              <p>Accounting for Nature emphasises measuring the condition of
        environmental assets with a standardised approach to ecological
        health metrics. While this focus is valuable, it can limit
        broader application until further refinement and validation
        across diverse contexts. In contrast, the Natural Capital
        Protocol offers comprehensive impact measurement, assessing
        business impacts on natural capital across all industries and
        geographies. This approach to identifying, measuring, and
        valuing natural capital impacts makes it more adaptable and
        relevant for many businesses.</p>

        impact, the need for internationally comparable data, and
        underdeveloped impact measurement practices. Among the most
        recognised frameworks are the Global Impact Investing Network’s

            <p>The impact investing market has seen significant growth, with
      more investors seeking investments that align with their values
      while offering competitive returns. The growing awareness of
      global challenges such as climate change, social inequality, and
      biodiversity loss drives this trend. Pension funds and
      institutional investors increasingly commit substantial capital to
      sustainable investments, directing more funds toward energy
      transition and other impact-focused initiatives. For instance, the
      California Public Employees’ Retirement System recently announced
      a $100 billion commitment toward climate solutions by 2030, moving
      its portfolio closer to net zero. The New York State Common
      Retirement Fund also doubled its sustainable investment commitment
      to $40 billion to protect state pensions from climate risk. In
      Europe, many investors commit percentages of their investment
      portfolio to Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)
      Article 9 funds, which must fulfil specific requirements to be
      classified as sustainable (Eisenberg and Plakalo
      (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

          <list-item>
            <label>42.</label>
            <p>The European market has witnessed a rise in specialised impact
      funds, with established investment firms launching new products to
      address specific environmental and social challenges. British
      global investment firm Permira launched its first energy
      transition fund, and private equity company EQT closed its EQT
      Future Fund, the most significant impact fund ever raised in
      private markets. Additionally, private equity firms Ardian,
      Eurazeo, and Tikehau have launched nature, biodiversity, and other
      specialised funds focused on clean hydrogen, sustainable
      agriculture, and energy transition funds in credit, real estate,
      and other underpenetrated asset classes. As these funds deploy
      more capital and demonstrate a track record, the industry
      continues to grow, offering more directed and specific solutions
      for limited partners. This mobilises substantial capital toward
      innovative solutions that address pressing environmental and
      social challenges (Eisenberg and Plakalo
      (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

            <label>43.</label>
            <p>Infrastructure investments have also drawn significant
      attention, with some of the largest US-based general partners and
      investors focusing on energy transition platforms. Firms like
      Brookfield, TPG Rise Climate, Apollo, Ares, Blackstone, and KKR
      have all announced new energy transition funds and commitments to
      energy transition investments over the past year. This
      consolidation among general partners is led primarily by large
      managers responding to their limited partners’ interest in
      increasing commitments to positive impact through infrastructure
      and impact investments. According to the GIIN, the five most
      considerable impact investing general partners accounted for 47%
      of the total assets under management in the impact investment
      market. Since last May, several top private equity firms have
      acquired infrastructure investing capabilities, offering a broader
      range of strategies to limited partners and bringing new energy
      transition competencies into their firms (Eisenberg and Plakalo

            <p>Impact investing in Asia is experiencing significant growth,
      driven by the need for financial support for expanding businesses
      and addressing social and environmental challenges. Over the past
      15 years, particularly in Southeast Asia, impact investments have
      surged, with investors committing over two-thirds of the total
      capital from 2007–2016 in just the last three years (2020-2022).
      This growth includes a 40% increase in investment and projects
      compared to the previous three years. Development finance
      institutions have also maintained annual investments of around
      US$2 billion over the past six years. Despite these positive
      trends, challenges remain, such as bridging the funding gap for
      early-stage businesses and ensuring investments address issues
      like greenhouse gas emissions, gender equality, and aging
      populations. Initiatives like USAID’s ESG program in Vietnam
      highlight efforts to promote sustainable growth, supporting small
      and growing businesses crucial to the country’s socio-economic
      development and environmental sustainability. This expanding
      market encourages Asian companies to prioritise sustainability and
      social responsibility, benefiting investors and the broader
      community (Richter

              <p>Market growth trends can give us an understanding of impact
        dimensions that face increased scrutiny. For example, one
        significant dimension is the increasing focus on climate
        resilience and energy transition. With institutional investors
        like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System
        committing substantial capital toward climate solutions, there
        is a clear shift towards investments that offer financial
        returns and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
        enhancing climate resilience. The emergence of specialised funds
        dedicated to clean hydrogen, sustainable agriculture, and
        renewable energy highlights this trend. The commitment to energy
        transition is further evidenced by the launch of new energy
        transition funds by firms such as Brookfield, TPG Rise Climate,
        and Apollo (Eisenberg and Plakalo
        (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

              <label>46.</label>
              <p>The alignment of investments with social and equity values is
        becoming a critical consideration for impact investors. This
        trend is driven by recognising the importance of addressing
        social determinants of health and well-being, as well as the
        need for inclusive economic growth. The rise of Sustainable
        Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Article 9 funds in Europe,
        which require strict adherence to sustainability criteria,
        reflects a growing demand for investments that promote social
        equity and address systemic inequalities (Eisenberg and Plakalo
        (<xref alt="2024" rid="ref-eisenberg2024-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2024</xref>)).</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>47.</label>
              <p>Social equity and inclusion have also gained increased
        scrutiny and importance among impact investors in the
        Asia-Pacific region. According to the report “Advancing Impact:
        A Road Map for Social Investing in Asia,” several key trends
        have emerged. There is a growing emphasis on gender equality and
        women’s empowerment, with investments targeting female
        entrepreneurs and women-led businesses. Initiatives like
        Indonesia’s Ojek Syari, a female-only ride-hailing service,
        illustrate how social investments can address both economic
        empowerment and safety for women. Additionally, there is a focus
        on improving health and education outcomes in underserved
        communities. Investments in nutrition supplement companies in
        China and educational programs in rural India highlight
        commitment to addressing fundamental social determinants of
        health and education disparities. Furthermore, the report
        emphasises the importance of local context and stakeholder
        engagement in designing and implementing social investment
        projects, ensuring that interventions are culturally appropriate
        and have the support of the communities they aim to serve (The
        Economist Group
        (<xref alt="2022" rid="ref-economist2022-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>)).</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>48.</label>
              <p>Other aspects under the social dimension include the impact
        of best practices on work environments. Certifications such as
        “Great Place to Work” and adherence to the Global Compact
        principles highlight the importance of ethical business
        practices, employee well-being, and corporate social
        responsibility. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is
        another critical tool that helps investors assess and address
        the multifaceted nature of poverty, ensuring that investments
        contribute to reducing deprivation in areas such as health,
        education, and living standards. These frameworks and
        certifications not only improve the quality of work environments
        but also promote broader social goals, aligning business
        practices with the pursuit of inclusive and sustainable
        development.</p>

              <label>49.</label>
              <p>The need for a comprehensive and interconnected approach to
        impact assessment has become increasingly critical in recent
        years. Published reports by the (European Commission
        (<xref alt="2023" rid="ref-ec2023-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>))
        and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (2023)
        highlight evolving trends that emphasise integrating a holistic
        ecosystem perspective within national and international nature
        targets. Adopting this approach is essential when addressing
        issues like “impact washing” and enhancing impact measurement
        and verification processes. Accounting frameworks like
        Accounting for Nature, the Natural Capital Protocol, Taskforce
        on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and SEEA
        emphasise a comprehensive view of ecosystems and stress their
        interconnectedness, where sustainable development depends on
        multilayered and interrelated aspects. Such frameworks help
        identify synergies and trade-offs within ecosystems, ensuring
        that the diverse services of nature are accurately evaluated and
        appreciated.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <label>50.</label>
              <p>Implementing nature-based accounting standards (NCA) is
        crucial to addressing impact washing. Holistic NCAs utilise
        detailed measurement standards that capture an aggregate range
        of environmental impacts. This thorough approach reduces the
        likelihood of overstating or falsely claiming benefits within
        impact investment. Impact washing deals with wrongly depicting
        the effects of investments, often by focusing solely on positive
        outcomes while neglecting negative impacts. As noted by Bendell
        (2019), we can only ensure we achieve our intended net societal
        and environmental benefits if we measure and manage both
        positive and negative outcomes. This requires a comprehensive
        impact assessment approach, integrating multi-dimensional
        metrics to provide an honest and accurate evaluation of
        investments. By adhering to rigorous, science-based frameworks
        such as NCAs, stakeholders can maintain transparency and
        accountability, ensuring that investments contribute genuinely
        to sustainable development goals and avoid the pitfalls of
        misleading impact claims. The United Nations Office for Disaster
        Risk Reduction (2023) report emphasises the importance of
        recognising co-benefits of nature-based solutions, such as
        biodiversity conservation, climate regulation, and improved
        human well-being. This aligns with ecosystem accounting
        principles, which advocate measuring and valuing multiple
        ecosystem services based on asset condition and extent
        assessments to inform decision-making. The implication is that
        impact assessments should focus on more than just single
        outcomes and capture the interconnected benefits and trade-offs
        of environmental investments.</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>51.</label>
              <p>Second, stakeholders can avoid impact washing using
        frameworks like Accounting for Nature, the Natural Capital
        Protocol, or SEEA by ensuring that all relevant environmental
        services and ecosystem interconnections are considered through
        science-based metrics. This prevents the narrow focus on single
        metrics, which can be misleading, easily manipulated, or
        diminish impact returns. Instead, the frameworks can provide
        multi-dimensional views of impact, highlighting both positive
        outcomes and potential negative trade-offs within ecosystems
        and, therefore, impact outcomes. The report of the European
        Commission (2023) emphasises that the credibility and accuracy
        of impact assessments are heavily dependent on the quality and
        scientific rigour of the metrics used.</p>

              <label>52.</label>
              <p>Finally, the European Commission’s report (2023) emphasises
        the importance of considering spatial and temporal scales in
        impact assessments, acknowledging that nature-based solutions
        can have varying impacts over different geographic areas and
        timeframes. Additionally, the report highlights the importance
        of engaging stakeholders and considering the socio-economic
        context in designing and assessing nature-based solutions. These
        considerations stress the need for robust natural accounting
        frameworks that incorporate and promote continuous monitoring
        and rigorous assessment to ensure accurate and comprehensive
        evaluations. Integrating spatial, temporal, and socio-economic
        factors, nature accounting frameworks can help mitigate impact
        washing by ensuring that investments are transparently and
        accurately measured, managed and reported. A comprehensive
        approach enables the alignment of investment capital more
        closely with sustainable development goals and international
        standards, reinforcing genuine positive impacts of impact
        investments.</p>

            <list-item>
              <label>53.</label>
              <p>A well-established dimension in impact investing focuses on
        efforts to preserve environmental health through sustainable
        resource management. This dimension encompasses innovation and
        controls on waste and other sources of pollution, and on water
        and other resources management, all of which are vital for
        public health and community well-being. The global increase in
        waste production has driven the need for advanced waste
        management solutions, including recycling technologies and
        waste-to-energy systems. According to the United Nations
        Environment Programme (UNEP), these innovations help reduce the
        environmental footprint and promote resource efficiency (UNEP,
        2021). Standards and certifications such as Zero Waste to
        Landfill and tools like LCA (Lifecycle Assessments) are
        continuously growing in adoption. Similarly, impact investors
        are increasingly supporting initiatives that tackle other
        pollution controls, including efforts to reduce air, noise, and
        water pollution, all linked to severe health issues and
        environmental degradation (World Health Organization, 2018).
        Initiatives include those that develop cleaner industrial
        processes, emissions reduction technologies, and sustainable
        agricultural practices, among others. These investments are
        crucial in addressing the adverse effects of pollutants on
        communities, particularly in densely populated urban areas where
        air quality concerns are most acute, and on the oceans
        (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <label>54.</label>
              <p>Water management also plays a vital role in this dimension,
        particularly in regions facing water scarcity and contamination
        challenges. Investments are being directed toward improving
        water infrastructure, promoting water conservation technologies,
        and developing systems for better water quality monitoring and
        management. These efforts are essential in ensuring access to
        clean and safe water, which is fundamental to public health and
        economic development (World Resources Institute, 2020). At a
        corporate scale, frameworks, standards, and even credit schemes
        such as the Water Footprint, ISO 14046: Environmental
        Management-Water Footprint, LEED Water Efficiency credits, and
        the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard are also
        growing in demand and requirements as water scarcity becomes a
        more pressing issue globally (International Organization for
        Standardization
        (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-iso2018-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>)).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <label>55.</label>
              <p>The emphasis on environmental health through sustainable
        resource management is further reflected as a whole in
        regulatory frameworks and global standards. For instance, the
        European Union’s Green Deal and Circular Economy Action Plan
        promote sustainable production and consumption patterns,
        encouraging investments that align with these goals. Moreover,
        international agreements like the Paris Agreement highlight the
        interconnectedness of environmental health and climate action,
        underscoring the need for integrated approaches to address these
        issues (European Commission, 2019; United Nations Framework
        Convention on Climate Change, 2015). In that sense, as
        previously mentioned, frameworks such as GRI, ISO 14001, and B
        Corp Certification promote environmental management practices by
        helping organizations minimize their environmental footprint,
        comply with applicable laws and regulations, and continually
        improve their environmental performance (Global Reporting
        Initiative
        (<xref alt="2021" rid="ref-gri2021-nb-article" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>)).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <label>56.</label>
              <p>By prioritizing investments in environmental practices such
        as waste management, pollution control, and water management,
        impact investors can contribute to significant environmental and
        social benefits. These include improved public health outcomes,
        enhanced resilience to environmental changes, and the promotion
        of sustainable development. As awareness of these issues grows,
        the demand for solutions that address environmental health and
        sustainable resource management will likely continue to rise,
        making this an increasingly important dimension in the impact
        investment landscape.</p>

          <list-item>
            <label>57.</label>
            <p>The Australian and global marketplace for nature-related
      frameworks and standards in undergoing rapid evolution and is far
      from a state of maturity. Different frameworks and standards have
      highly heterogenous subject matter scopes and methodological
      design. This complicates any assessment of trade-offs between
      different exchange design choices, and creates risks of adverse
      consequences and path dependencies if premature choices are made
      to adopt certain methods, frameworks or standards.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>58.</label>
            <p>Another complicating factor is the fundamental uncertainty
      concerning the scope of assets intended for listing on the
      proposed AIX. Establishing public exchanges based on verified
      environmental and social outcomes (“Impact Exchanges”) involves
      careful design choices—about the specific measurement and
      verification methods, frameworks and standards that determine
      market disclosures. These design choices depend fundamentally on
      the scope of assets or instruments that can be traded—for example
      Impact Exchanges focused on:</p>
            <p>– corporate securities might be best underpinned by holistic
      disclosure frameworks such as those maintained by the Capitals
      Coalition (e.g. the Natural Capital Protocol), or Taskforces for
      Nature-Related, and Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD
      and TCFD respectively).</p>
            <p>– enabling impact investment might be best underpinned by the
      existing dedicated frameworks such as Global Impact Investing
      Network’s (GIIN) IRIS+, the Social Return on Investment (SROI),
      the Social Performance Task Force (SPTF), B Impact Assessment
      (BIA) by B Lab, and the Impact Management Project (IMP).</p>
            <p>– commodities or real property may be well matched with primary
      low-level measurement frameworks such as those developed for
      specific sectoral raw material supply chains (e.g. apparel,
      minerals and metals, etc), or environmental characteristics
      (e.g. pollution levels, in-situ biodiversity).</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>59.</label>
            <p>An alternative approach for AIX to consider is to adopt
      “meta-standards” that establish key priorities and principles
      (transparency, methodological replicability, clarity of scope and
      focus, etc) for disclosure of all nature-related frameworks and
      standards utilised by assets traded on the exchange. This approach
      has analogies in other fast-moving sectors (e.g. telecommunication
      regulation) and could ensure a balance between flexible
      innovation, coherent methodological specialisation for specific
      traded asset classes, and investor requirements.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>60.</label>
            <p>Further research is needed to establish and stress test the
      specific principles and requirements that would be incorporated
      into the “meta-standard” for environmental and social metrics.
      Some candidate principles are summarised below:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
              <list-item>
                <p>Principle 1: Traded assets should disclose both their
          primary environmental and social outcomes (quantified or
          qualified as appropriate) and the methodological basis for
          assessing those outcomes.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>Principle 2: The disclosed methodological basis for
          disclosure should be compatible with certain quality standards
          intended to support alignment with general fiduciary
          principles and Australian consumer regulation. They
          should:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>(2A) Transparently document their definitional
              foundations, input data and assessment methods. Low-level
              environmental definitions should be aligned with the SEEA
              as appropriate, in particular to avoid confusion between
              measurement of environmental stocks (e.g. the extent
              and/or condition of specific ecosystem types aligned to
              the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology) and flows of goods and
              services from the environment to the economy (e.g. carbon
              sequestration, regulation of waste, flows of raw
              materials).</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>(2B) Clearly document their functional, geographical
              and value chain scope coverage (e.g. 1+2 vs 3) and use
              pre-defined categories aligned to the SEEA and other
              relevant global statistical standards.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>

          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>61.</label>
            <p>We also suggest that a standing technical committee should be
      incorporated into the governance planning for the AIX with a clear
      remit to iteratively refine and develop meta-standards concerning
      social and environmental outcome disclosure, and facilitate
      pre-competitive dialogue between different frameworks, standards
      and approaches.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <label>62.</label>
            <p>A pragmatic alternative to the “meta-standards” approach
      suggested above would be to establish an Impact Exchange based on
      clear social and environmental outcome metrics for which there is
      short-term market demand, regardless of asset class. One advantage
      of this approach is the ability to generate liquidity and positive
      margins that could be reinvested into improving and scaling the
      Impact Exchange. A key risk is that metrics may evolve in response
      to ad-hoc demand drivers without sufficient attention to
      generating the coherence, robustness and transparency needed to
      bring investment in environmental and social outcomes to scale.
      The fundamental structural deficiencies of both voluntary and
      statutory carbon markets identified in recent years offers a
      pertinent cautionary tale.</p>
